How to play:
*You start off with a town center, 4 workers, and some resources around you.
*Drag units with the left mouse.
*Drag a worker over a resouce and press middle mouse or space. The worker will begin to harvest that resource
*Harvesters don't return the materials. For this you need a transporter. Drag a unit over a mineral that needs to be stored and the worker will become a transporter. Transporters will continue to collect resources that need to be collected. They will bring them to the nearest drop off point, where the resource will be stored for spending.
*You can also drag resources manually, but it is usually easyer and faster to let a transporter do it.
*You can't move complete buildings. You can move uncompleted buildings, but they cannot overlap other buildings or resources.
*Drag a worker over an incomplete building, press middle mouse or space and it will become a builder. Builders find the nearest building that needs construction and works on it. They will continue to do this as long as a building site is in range
*Right click a worker with a different class to change it back to a normal worker.
*You can move the screen with asdw or arrow keys
*Open the shop with enter or e.
NOTE: This game is still a demo, so that is all you can do so far. More will be in future versions.
